# Two Pointer approach/pattern or algorithm

##1.  palindrome    


time complexity => O(n/2) => O(n)    
space complexity=> O(1) remain constant   

### Concept:  
Basically space and time complexities are the functions of input, if
depending on input size the time increases ,in this case O(n)
spaceComplexit, depending on input size remains the same , why because
the same memory footprint is used it is not growing on run time or with
input
